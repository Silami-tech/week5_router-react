                    Internet marketing is conceptually different from other marketing channels and internet promotes a one to one 
communication between the seller and the end user with round the clock customer service. Today, business 
internet marketing is the fastest growing segment of online commerce. The major difference between traditional 
and online selling is the extent of interaction between the consumer and the seller. There is much more electronic
